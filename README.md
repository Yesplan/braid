<h4 align="center">Standup board for PivotalTracker</h4>

## The problem

You want to hold standups in your team, but you don't want to spend time writing and maintaing post-it notes on a physical board.

And if you do write the post-it notes, the remote developers cannot see them during the standup.

## The solution

Let Braid visualize the stories from the current iteration in the regular 4 column kaban style layout.

Braid lets you filter the stories by owner so you can easily get through the stanup without looking for your own stories.

## What Braid is not

A replacement for the PivotalTracker interface. If you want to do searching, editing, planning or anything else - go to the PivotalTracker webpage.
